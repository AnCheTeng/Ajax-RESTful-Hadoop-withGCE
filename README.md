We use Node.js, Express as backend server framework, and MongoDB as backend database.

Before use the hadoop-analysis, please run the following command first to make directory in hadoop-filesystem :
----->hdfs dfs â€“mkdir CCTslog

Then use forever.js to run in the backend:
----->forever start Hadoop_RESTful.js
